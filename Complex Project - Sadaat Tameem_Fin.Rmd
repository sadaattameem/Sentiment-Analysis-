### Introduction 
I conducted text analytics on customer reviews for Indian IT companies as part of my preparation to open a new business in the industry. The dataset consisted of reviews obtained from various sources, providing insights into the pain points experienced by customers.

By analyzing the reviews, I aimed to understand the common issues and challenges faced by customers when dealing with Indian IT companies. This information was crucial in developing a customer-centric business strategy that addresses these concerns effectively.

Through text analytics, I gained valuable insights into recurring themes and specific pain points highlighted by customers. By addressing these pain points, I aimed to create a business model that caters to the specific needs and expectations of Indian IT customers.

Understanding and resolving customer pain points would enable me to design the right products, services, and customer experiences that mitigate the challenges faced by customers in the Indian IT industry. This customer-centric approach would lay a strong foundation for my business,trust, loyalty, and success in the market.

### Data Description 

#### Data Source:

The most challenging and intriguing part of this project was the web scraping process in Python conducted on the website "https://www.mouthshut.com/websites". This involved understanding the webpage structure and meticulously investigating each page's XPath. The task required dealing with various loops, as the main page contained multiple sections, each with its own set of pages, and within those pages were numerous reviews.

One of the major obstacles encountered during web scraping was handling the numerous ad pop-ups. I implemented logic to wait for elements to become visible before executing the code. Despite these challenges, the web scraping endeavor proved to be highly rewarding. It emerged as a project within the project, enabling me to successfully extract three crucial data points: company name, review title, and average star rating.

To ensure robustness and continuity, I incorporated a loop for both review page numbers and the page number from which the information was scraped. This approach allowed the scraping process to restart from a specific webpage in case of any failures or interruptions in the script.

Overall, the web scraping phase presented a complex yet fascinating aspect of the project. It demanded a deep understanding of webpage structures, effective handling of ad pop-ups, and meticulous implementation of loops. Through this process, I successfully gathered valuable information, laying the foundation for further analysis and insights in the project.

#### Data dictionary:

1. Page: This is a numerical value representing the main page number from which the record is obtained.\n
2. Review Page: This is a numerical value indicating the review page number from which the review information is scraped.\n
3. Title: This refers to the company name associated with the review.\n
4. Review: This contains the user's review about the company.\n
5. Star: This represents the average star rating given to the company.\n

The data dictionary provides a clear description of each data point extracted through the scraping process, enabling better understanding and interpretation of the collected information.

Data set observations:
Total Columns = 5
Total Rows = 42,331 

#### Reading and Preprocessing: (After webscraping in Python)

##### Excel File Reading and Saving into Proj Variable
```{r Reading the file}
Proj <- read_excel("/Users/sadaattameem/Desktop/R_text_analysis_project_data.xlsx")

#Viewing the first 5 rows
head(Proj,n=5)
Proj
```


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data Structure, Handling Null Values, and Histogram Analysis of the DataFrame
```{r EDA}
#Filtering the data for 11 pages to maintain uniformity for further text analytics
Proj <- Proj %>%
  filter(`Review Page` <= 11)

#Viewing the structure of the Dataframe
str(Proj)

#finding null data 
null_counts <- colSums(is.na(Proj))

#viewing null data
null_counts

#Dropping null values 
Proj <- na.omit(Proj)

#Again viewing null values to confirm 
null_counts <- colSums(is.na(Proj))
null_counts


#Group the data by the "Title" column and calculate the maximum value for each title, storing the result in a new data frame.
Proj_unique_by_company <- Proj %>%
  group_by(Title) %>%
  summarize(Star = max(Star))

#view the new data frame 
Proj_unique_by_company


#Summary statistics of numerical variables
summary(Proj$Star)

#Histogram of stars
ggplot(Proj_unique_by_company, aes(Star)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill='blue') +
  labs(x = "Stars", y = "Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Average Rating Stars")


```

When observing the Histogram, it becomes apparent that the average star rating is predominantly concentrated between 2 and 4. This indicates that there is room for improvement by promptly addressing the pressing issues that users are experiencing, focusing on resolving their pain points


#### Combining the plots 

Generating a plot to perform analysis on the Average Star Ratings of the Top 20 and Bottom 20 Companies
```{r Plot}
#Top 20 companies
company_counts_top <- Proj %>%
  group_by(Title) %>%
  summarize(Star = max(Star)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Star)) %>%
  head(20)

plot_top <- ggplot(company_counts_top, aes(reorder(Title, Star), Star)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(x = "Company", y = "Star") +
  ggtitle("Reviews by Company (Top 20)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))


#Bottom 20 companies
company_counts_bottom <- Proj %>%
  group_by(Title) %>%
  summarize(Star = max(Star)) %>% 
  arrange(Star) %>%
  head(20)

plot_bottom <- ggplot(company_counts_bottom, aes(reorder(Title, Star), Star)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "red") +
  labs(x = "Company", y = "Star") +
  ggtitle("Reviews by Company (Bottom 20)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

#Get the maximum y-axis value from both plots
y_max <- max(c(company_counts_top$Star, company_counts_bottom$Star))

#Combine the plots with same y-axis limits
combined_plot <- grid.arrange(
  plot_top + ylim(0, y_max),
  plot_bottom + ylim(0, y_max),
  ncol = 2
)
```

The plot above illustrates the extreme ends of the spectrum, showcasing the Top 20 companies with the highest star ratings and the Bottom 20 companies with the lowest star ratings. This visualization serves as a valuable tool for conducting in-depth analysis.


### Text Analysis

#### Tokenization
The text data was tokenized by splitting it into individual words, phrases, or tokens based on whitespace and punctuation marks. This process enables further analysis and extraction of valuable insights from the text data.
```{r Tokenization}
text <- Proj %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word,
                input = Review)

#Viewing the Data file
text
```

#### Stop Word Removal and Custom Stop Word Creation
In this step, stop words are removed from the text data, and a custom stop word dictionary is created and used to eliminate additional words. By removing these common and non-informative words, we can improve the accuracy and relevance of our text analysis.

During the analysis, it was observed that the stop words included some words present in the title. To address this, a customized stop word list was created by incorporating those title words, and they were subsequently removed from the text data. This step ensures that the title words do not interfere with the analysis and allow for more accurate results.


```{r Stop Words}
word_counts <- text %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% #remove stop words
  count(Title,word,sort=T)

# Print the updated data frame

Proj$Title_2 <- sapply(strsplit(Proj$Title, ".", fixed = TRUE), "[", 1)

stop_company_names<-unique(Proj$Title_2)

stop_company_names <- tibble(word = stop_company_names)
stop_company_names<-tibble(tolower(stop_company_names$word))
colnames(stop_company_names)
my_stop <- rename(stop_company_names, "word" = "tolower(stop_company_names$word)")

#now removing the company names:
company_word <- text %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% #remove stop words
  anti_join(my_stop) %>% 
  count(Title,word,sort=T)
#viewing the data after removing custom stop words
company_word
```

Understanding these key words and their frequencies can help the company identify areas of improvement, prioritize customer satisfaction initiatives, and enhance the overall customer experience.




### Bi Gram Analysis 
After observing the high frequency of certain words such as "customer" and "services" separately, as well as "delivery," "days," "website," and "apps," it became apparent that conducting a bi-gram analysis would provide valuable insights into their relationship and overall importance. By examining these words in pairs, we can uncover any patterns or associations that may not be evident when considering them individually.
```{r Bi gram}

# Perform bi-gram analysis on the project dataset
company_bigram <- Proj %>% 
  unnest_tokens(bigram, Review, token = "ngrams", n = 2)

# Separate the bi-gram into individual words
company_bigram <- company_bigram %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") 

# Filter out stop words from the bi-grams
company_bigram <- company_bigram %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

# Remove rows with missing values in word1 or word2
company_bigrams <- company_bigram %>%
  filter(!is.na(word1)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(word2))

# Unite word1 and word2 to create the final bi-gram column
company_bigrams <- company_bigrams %>%
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")

# Count the occurrences of each bi-gram by company
company_bigrams_count <- company_bigrams %>% count(Title, bigram, sort = TRUE)

# Perform bi-gram analysis on the project dataset for overall word frequency
bigram_counts <- Proj %>% 
  unnest_tokens(bigram, Review, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!is.na(word1)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(word2)) %>% 
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)

# Create a graph from the bi-gram counts
bigram_graph <- bigram_counts %>%
  filter(n >= 150) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame()

# Visualize the bi-gram graph using the Fruchterman-Reingold layout
suppressWarnings({
  ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
    geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = n), show.legend = FALSE,
                   arrow = grid::arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(2, "mm")),
                   end_cap = circle(1, "mm")) +
    geom_node_point(color = "lightblue", linewidth = 2) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name), size = 2) +
    theme_void() +
    theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "points")) +
    guides(linewidth = FALSE)

})
```

Here are some notable bigrams and their interpretations:

customer->care, customer->service, customer->support: These bigrams suggest a strong association between the word "customer" and different aspects of service and support. It indicates that customer care, service, and support are important considerations in the data.

online->shopping, shopping->site, shopping->website: These bigrams indicate a relationship between the words "online" and "shopping" as well as their association with websites and sites. It suggests that the data may contain feedback or experiences related to online shopping platforms.

bad->experience, worst->experience, pathetic->service: These bigrams highlight negative experiences, indicating dissatisfaction or disappointment expressed by the customers. It suggests that there are instances of poor service, bad experiences, and dissatisfaction in the data.

delivery->time, delivery->date, delivery->boy: These bigrams suggest a connection between the word "delivery" and aspects related to time, date, and delivery personnel (boy). It indicates that the data may include feedback or comments related to delivery experiences.

product->quality, earn->money, return->policy: These bigrams indicate a relationship between the words "product" and "quality" as well as associations between earning money and return policies. It suggests that the data may involve discussions about product quality, earning money, and return policies of certain companies.

fraud->company, pathetic->service, bad->service: These bigrams highlight negative experiences related to fraud, pathetic service, and bad service. It indicates that there are instances where customers encountered fraudulent activities or experienced unsatisfactory service from specific companies.

Overall, the bigram analysis helps identify frequently co-occurring word pairs, shedding light on the relationships and associations between the words. It provides valuable insights into customer experiences, service quality, online shopping, delivery, and other aspects discussed in the data.






### Topic Modelling 

Through topic modeling, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the customer feedback landscape. It provides a powerful tool for extracting actionable insights, enabling us to make informed decisions and prioritize areas of focus based on customer needs and preferences.

Now, let's dive into the process of topic modeling and explore the fascinating world of customer feedback analysis.


After conducting topic modeling analysis, I removed common words like "product," "delivery," "service," and "job" to gain more meaningful insights. I started with 3 topics and gradually increased the number to find the best model. The optimal number of topics was determined to be 5, which successfully captured the diverse themes in the customer feedback
```{r Topic Modeling}
# Find document-word counts
company_word <- text %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% # Remove stop words
  anti_join(my_stop) %>%
  count(Title, word, sort = TRUE)

unwanted_words <- c("product", "delivery", "service", "job")  # List of words to remove

filtered_word_counts <- subset(company_word, !word %in% unwanted_words)

word_counts <- filtered_word_counts

# Make into DTM (Document-Term Matrix)
title_dtm <- word_counts %>%
  cast_dtm(document = Title,
           term = word,
           value = n)

# Display word counts
word_counts

# Perform Topic Modeling with 5 topics
title_lda <- LDA(title_dtm, k = 5, control = list(seed = 1234))

# Extract the topic-word probabilities
title_topics <- tidy(title_lda, matrix = "beta")

# Find the most common words in each topic

### Labeling Topics 
After analyzing the words in each topic, several insights emerged:

1.Customer Service: This topic captures discussions related to customer service interactions, response time, and phone support. The presence of terms like "customer," "time," and "call" suggests a focus on addressing customer queries and providing efficient assistance.

2.Website and App Experience: This topic revolves around users' experiences with the company's website and mobile application. Keywords such as "website," "site," and "app" indicate conversations related to user interface, navigation, and overall satisfaction with the digital platforms.

3.Payment and Booking Issues: This topic highlights concerns regarding payments, customer reimbursements, and booking problems. Terms like "money," "customer," and "refund" suggest discussions centered around payment failures, refund requests, and difficulties in the booking process.

4.Product Quality and Website Experience: This topic delves into the quality of products offered by the company and user experiences on their website. The presence of terms like "products," "quality," "site," and "website" indicates conversations about product reliability, satisfaction, and ease of online browsing and shopping.

5.Overall Experience and Travel: This topic encompasses broader discussions about customers' overall experiences and interactions with the company during their travel. Terms such as "experience," "time," "trip," "team," and "travel" signify a focus on travel-related aspects like customer experiences, trip arrangements, and interactions with the company's team.

By identifying these distinct topics, the company can gain valuable insights into specific areas that require attention and improvement. Addressing customer service concerns, enhancing the website and app experience, resolving payment and booking issues, ensuring product quality, and optimizing the overall travel experience will contribute to enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.

                        "4" = topic_labels[4], "5" = topic_labels[5])) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = beta, y = term, fill = topic_original)) +  # Use the original topic values for fill
